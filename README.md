# Ray-Traced Solar System in OpenGL

This project is a OpenGL application that models a solar system using ray tracing techniques. The solar system consists of various planets and one or more suns, which are traced onto the screen using rays.

## Tasks

In this project, I undertook the following tasks:

1. **Implementation of Ray Tracing Shader:** I was responsible for implementing the ray tracing algorithm in the shader. This shader is responsible for tracing the rays, checking for intersections with objects, and simulating shadow effects.

2. **Dynamic Adjustment of Ray Tracing Depth:**
I implemented functionality to dynamically adjust the depth of ray tracing using buttons in the user interface. Users can increase or decrease the maximum depth of ray tracing during runtime

## Screenshots
Below are some screenshots showcasing the project.
